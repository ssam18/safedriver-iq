## Project Overview

SafeDriver-IQ transforms crash data into a continuous safety score that tells drivers in real-time how close they are to crash conditions and what specific actions would make them safer, with special focus on protecting vulnerable road users (VRUs).

### 🆕 NEW: Comprehensive Crash Factor Investigation (Notebook 04)
A deep-dive multi-dataset investigation combining **CRSS** (417K crashes) and **Waymo Open Motion Dataset** to answer 8 core research questions:
1. What factors contribute to vehicle crashes?
2. Which features best predict crash probability?
3. How to classify driver behavior from crash and good-driving data?
4. What data is most critical for VRU/pedestrian/cyclist predictions?
5. What patterns can improve crash prevention model training?
6. What historical crash trends are present across 2016–2023?
7. What environmental conditions uniquely elevate crash risk?
8. How to systematically perform root cause analysis?

**Key addition — Contextual Feature Synthesis:** CRSS captures crash *outcomes* but is silent on contextual preconditions. A new `ContextualFeatureGenerator` synthesises 16 research-calibrated risk dimensions (see [Section 6](#section-6--comprehensive-crash-factor-analysis-beyond-crss-data) in notebook 04) drawn from NHTSA, FHWA-HSM, AAA Foundation, and IIHS sources, enabling richer training and what-if simulation.

### 🤖 Agentic AI Integration (Phase 1 Complete)
Now features an **autonomous decision-making system** that actively prevents crashes through:
- Real-time risk assessment and autonomous interventions
- Continuous learning from driving experiences
- Multi-modal driver notifications (visual, audio, haptic)
- Transparent, explainable AI reasoning
- [Learn more →](AGENTIC_AI_README.md) | [View plan →](AGENTIC_AI_PLAN.md)

### The Problem
- **7,500+ pedestrian deaths/year** in the USA (40-year high)
- **1,000+ cyclist deaths/year**
- Traditional systems are **reactive** (emergency braking) not **proactive**
- No system tells drivers "you're driving safely" or "improve these specific behaviors"

### Our Solution
Instead of predicting crashes, we model the **distance from crash** - quantifying how "safe" a driving scenario is by measuring its statistical distance from crash-producing conditions.

## 📄 Research Publication

Visual one-page summaries for each phase of the work.

#### Phase 1: SafeDriver-IQ

![SafeDriver-IQ Phase 1 Flyer](docs/flyers/safedriver_iq_phase1_flyer.png)

Phase 1 introduces inverse crash probability modeling: a continuous 0–100 safety score derived from NHTSA CRSS crash data and Waymo driving behavior, demonstrating that 87% of crashes involve two or more co-occurring risk factors.

#### Phase 2: PRISM (ASCE2027)

![PRISM Phase 2 Flyer](docs/flyers/prism_phase2_flyer.png)

Phase 2 extends the foundation into an agentic multi-model architecture with environmental, trajectory, and VRU risk models fused by a DQN agent. PRISM was validated across nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and Waymo WOMD, achieving a mean safety score of 68/100 with 77.6% of scenarios classified as advisory.

## System Architecture

### Architecture Diagrams

#### SafeDriver-IQ (Phase 1) Architecture

![SafeDriver-IQ Architecture](docs/images/safedriver_iq_architecture.png)

SafeDriver-IQ is the first-generation inverse crash modeling system. It combines national crash statistics (CRSS 2016–2023) with real-world behavioral data (Waymo WOMD) to train a binary crash classifier, then inverts its predicted probability of *not* crashing into a continuous 0–100 safety score. The pipeline includes data ingestion, feature engineering (120+ variables), crash pattern analysis, model training, and a real-time scoring interface that maps scores to five risk levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Excellent.

#### PRISM (Phase 2) Agentic Multi-Model Architecture

![PRISM Architecture](docs/images/prism_architecture.png)

PRISM (Proactive Risk Intelligence and Safety Management) extends SafeDriver-IQ into a four-layer agentic architecture:

1. **Layer 1 — Data Ingestion and Normalization**: Converts heterogeneous AV datasets (nuScenes, Argoverse 2, Waymo WOMD) into a unified `DrivingScene` representation.
2. **Layer 2 — Parallel Risk Models**: Runs three independent models concurrently:
   - **Environmental Risk**: Reuses the frozen SafeDriver-IQ random forest as a context estimator.
   - **Trajectory Kinematic**: Evaluates speed, acceleration, and yaw-rate exceedances.
   - **VRU Interaction**: Uses a Social Force Model + LSTM to predict ego-VRU conflicts.
3. **Layer 3 — Agentic Reasoning**: Fuses risks via a DQN reinforcement learning agent, selects one of four intervention tiers (silent, advisory, intervention, emergency), and provides SHAP-based explanations with short-term and long-term memory.
4. **Layer 4 — Applications**: Supports ADAS integration, fleet risk management, and infrastructure planning without dataset-specific retraining.

pytest

# Run all tests with verbose output and short traceback (recommended)
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Run all tests with verbose output and one-line traceback (most concise)
pytest tests/ -v --tb=line

# Run tests without coverage calculation (faster)
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --no-cov

# Run tests in quiet mode with one-line traceback (minimal output)
pytest tests/ -q --tb=line

# Run with coverage report (detailed analysis)
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

**Test Output Options:**
- `-v` = verbose mode (shows each test name)
- `-q` = quiet mode (minimal output, just pass/fail counts)
- `--tb=short` = shorter traceback on failures (recommended for debugging)
- `--tb=line` = one-line traceback (most concise, good for CI/CD)
- `--no-cov` = skip coverage calculation (faster test runs)

**Test Realtime Calculator** (verifies condition changes affect scores):
```bash
# Run realtime calculator tests to verify model sensitivity
pytest tests/test_realtime_calculator.py -v --tb=short -s
```

Expected: 65 tests total (53 pass + 12 realtime tests with 5 expected failures due to known model limitations)

- **[notebooks/04_crash_factor_investigation.ipynb](notebooks/04_crash_factor_investigation.ipynb)** — Comprehensive crash factor investigation

## Known Issues & Limitations

The current trained model does not respond meaningfully to changes in **road condition**, **VRU presence**, or **speed relative to limit**. This is a fundamental limitation of training on crash-only data: the model never learned what "truly safe" driving looks like. It remains useful for weather, lighting, and temporal risk patterns. For test evidence, run `pytest tests/test_realtime_calculator.py -v --tb=short`.

The PRISM architecture (Phase 2) addresses this by adding separate trajectory-kinematic and VRU-interaction models, plus a DQN fusion agent. Validation results are in the `asce2027/` directory.
